# Nirvana-Herdr changelog

Each entry: Changed → Because → Measured → If you remove this. herdr's own changes are in the root CHANGELOG.md,
which the fork never edits.

## alpha 0.1.0 (2026-10-15): the Nirvana header, its version, and reload onto the newest build

Base: herdr master b431a063 (Cargo version 0.9.5).

- **Changed:** the sidebar's first row is the brand row: a teal ◆, "Nirvana" in bold, a badge "alpha 0.1.0", and the
  sidebar toggle « at its right edge (it was at the bottom right). " spaces" moved to the second row, which upstream
  left blank, so the workspace list keeps its place.
  **Because:** the owner, 2026-10-15: "have this element for the Herdr instance [Image #11]" (Nirvana's header).
  **Measured:** `brand_row_names_nirvana_and_its_running_version`, `a_narrow_sidebar_keeps_the_toggle_and_clips_the_badge`;
  controls `header_drops_version`, `header_badge_clipped` (the live run found the badge one column short).
  **If you remove this:** the window no longer says which build it runs.
- **Changed:** the fork has its own version in nirvana/VERSION, compiled in as NIRVANA_VERSION, bumped by
  nirvana/version.py. herdr's Cargo version is left alone.
  **Because:** Nirvana's rule 16, "That way I can see if the Nirvana window is running the new version"; herdr's
  version gates its update manifest and protocol checks, so moving it would break both.
  **Measured:** `version_comes_from_the_version_file`, `VersionTest`; controls `version_not_from_file`,
  `bump_feature_keeps_fix`.
  **If you remove this:** the badge has no number of its own to show.
- **Changed:** the server's background version check reads `<home>/bin/nirvana-version.txt` every 5 s instead of
  herdr's release manifest every 30 min, and announces each newer build once through herdr's existing
  `UpdateReady`. The badge then reads "↻ 0.1.1"; a press arms it ("restart?"), a second press detaches, stops the
  server (it saves the session), and exits 75; the `nirvana-shell` supervisor starts the installed build, which
  starts a new server that restores the session. `herdr update` refuses.
  **Because:** "hot realoding the newest changes", read from Nirvana's Reload. Two presses because a restart stops
  the programs in the panes: Windows has no live handoff (src/platform/mod.rs, "Windows has no live handoff").
  **Measured:** `the_stamp_beside_the_installed_build_is_read`, `only_a_later_build_is_newer`,
  `a_newer_build_turns_the_badge_into_a_reload_button`, `reload_takes_two_presses`, `InstallTest`; controls
  `header_reload_unclickable`, `reload_single_press`, `same_build_counts_as_newer`, `install_stamps_wrong_version`,
  `install_overwrites_old_build`. The live reload run is recorded in the plan.
  **If you remove this:** a new build sits unused until someone stops herdr by hand; with the update check back on,
  herdr would offer to install upstream herdr over the fork.
- **Changed:** the default window title is "{workspace} · Nirvana" (was "{hostname}: {workspace}").
  **Because:** the owner's image reads "Downloads · Nirvana": the project in view, then the product.
  **Measured:** `nirvana_default_title_names_the_project_then_nirvana`; control `title_upstream_default`.
  **If you remove this:** the Windows Terminal tab shows the machine name instead of the project.
