# Nirvana-Herdr changelog

Each entry: Changed → Because → Measured → If you remove this. herdr's own changes are in the root CHANGELOG.md,
which the fork never edits.

## alpha 0.4.0 (2026-10-15): running servers and usage at the foot of the sidebar

- **Changed:** the foot of the expanded sidebar, under the agents panel, holds old Nirvana's two blocks. "servers": one
  row per port a process in a space's panes listens on, the space's name and `localhost:<port>` (`:<port>` when the
  name needs the cells); a click opens it in the browser; the block hides when no space runs a server; four rows,
  then "+N more". "usage": Claude, Codex, Antigravity and Local, each with Nirvana's provider colour, the five-hour and
  seven-day windows in two columns under "5h 7D", and from 34 columns a bar for the five-hour window.
  **Because:** the owner, 2026-10-15: "Lets work on the next feature. This running server and usage from Nirvana lets
  port it to the Nirvana herder".
  **Measured:** `nirvana_footer::*` (eight rendering and click tests), `nirvana_servers::tests::*` (seven),
  `nirvana_usage::tests::*` (six); twenty-three controls, `servers_*`, `usage_*` and `footer_*`. The live run is in the
  plan's Record.
  **If you remove this:** which space runs a server, and how much of each subscription is left, is read outside herdr.
- **Changed:** a server is any TCP port listened on inside a space's panes (the shell and its whole tree), read by the
  server on one worker thread every 3 s and sent as the space's `nirvana_servers` token, so the wire is unchanged.
  Ports from 49152 up and ports owned by claude, codex, agy or Antigravity are not servers.
  **Because:** herdr has no daemon that starts servers, which is where old Nirvana's list came from. The live check
  found an idle Claude Code on 64839 and agy's app on 60015 and 60016, which a plain port scan would list.
  **Measured:** `plumbing_ports_are_not_servers`; controls `servers_dynamic_port_kept`, `servers_agent_port_kept`.
  **If you remove this:** each Claude, agy and helper adds a row that is not a server.
- **Changed:** the worker keeps reading a space while any of its pane shells runs, not only while a window asks.
  **Because:** the server rebuilds a window's snapshot when the sidebar's state changes, not on pane output. In the
  first live run a server's row stayed after the server stopped: the space had gone unasked for over 60 s, so the
  worker had dropped it, and the row never cleared.
  **Measured:** second live run, server idle 75 s then stopped: its row was gone 8 s later (plan Record);
  `a_space_is_read_while_a_shell_lives`, control `servers_dead_space_kept`.
  **If you remove this:** a server that stops after a quiet minute keeps its row until something else changes.
- **Changed:** the usage rows are read by the window, never the server: Claude by `claude -p /usage
  --no-session-persistence` (every 120 s while a Claude in the window works, else 600 s), Codex from its rollouts'
  `rate_limits` (30 s), Antigravity by `agy -p /usage` (300 s), Local from Ollama on 127.0.0.1:11434 and `nvidia-smi`
  (30 s). A failed read keeps the last figure.
  **Because:** Claude Code answers `/usage` locally: the live check returned model `<synthetic>`, 0 tokens, a cost of 0,
  in 2.7 s. Old Nirvana paid a model turn for its Claude reading. `--bare` drops the subscription sign-in and answers
  with the API cost view, so it is not used. agy's read took 20.8 s.
  **Measured:** the parsers' tests on text captured from this machine on 2026-10-15; `a_failed_read_keeps_the_last_figure`.
  **If you remove this:** the rows say "reading" forever.
- **Changed:** upstream's `sidebar_scrollbars_use_proportional_shared_geometry_and_drag` composes at 32 rows, not 26.
  **Because:** the foot takes six rows from the agents panel, which at 26 left its ten agents a one-cell thumb.
  **Measured:** at 32 both lists still overflow; the test asserts both tracks.
  **If you remove this:** that upstream test fails on the fork.

## alpha 0.3.0 (2026-10-15): each space lists its agents' task and model, with the agent's icon

- **Changed:** under each space in the spaces list, two rows per agent running there: the task's summarized title
  (Claude Code's terminal title, "No task yet" before the first prompt), then the agent's icon and its provider and
  model, e.g. "✻ Claude Sonnet 5.5". The icon takes the place of the status circle and keeps its colour (idle green,
  working yellow, blocked red, done teal). Icons: Claude ✻, Codex ❖, Antigravity ▲, Local ⌂; any other agent keeps
  herdr's dot. A space shows three agents, then "+N more"; the agents panel below still lists them all.
  **Because:** the owner, 2026-10-15: "See how in our old Nirvana we showcase the task a summerised title and its active
  model ... for herder it would be the model provider and tyle ie Claude Sonnet. ... Basically I would to have spaces do
  somethign similar and on the left Instead of a green circle its the agents Icon. We need one for claude antigravity
  codex and local."
  **Measured:** `nirvana_space_agents::*` (six rendering tests) and `nirvana_spaces::tests::*` (ten reader and label
  tests); eighteen controls, `spaces_*`. The live run is in the plan's Record.
  **If you remove this:** the spaces list shows only folder names; which agent and model works where is read pane by
  pane.
- **Changed:** the server reads each agent's model off its main loop: Claude from its transcript's last reply (found
  through `<config>/sessions/<pid>.json`), Codex from `--model` or its newest rollout in the pane's folder, Antigravity
  from `--model` or its log's last model switch. A Claude on a non-Anthropic model (Nirvana's local seat through
  Ollama) is Local. The result rides in the agent's existing `tokens` as `nirvana_kind` and `nirvana_model`, so the wire
  format is unchanged and an older server still talks to this client.
  **Because:** a model read on the server's loop would stall every pane's output; a new snapshot field would break an
  older server with a newer client, which the 0.1.0 server and 0.2.0 client did for a command on 2026-10-15.
  **Measured:** reads are cached for 3 s and run on one worker thread that wakes a render only when a model changed.
  **If you remove this:** the client has no model to draw.
- **Changed:** upstream's `sidebar_scrollbars_use_proportional_shared_geometry_and_drag` composes at 26 rows, not 20.
  **Because:** its ten agents now also draw under their space, so at 20 rows the spaces thumb is one cell.
  **Measured:** at 26 both lists still overflow; the test asserts both tracks.
  **If you remove this:** that upstream test fails on the fork.

## alpha 0.2.0 (2026-10-15): Restart Claude from the tab menu, same folder, same conversation

- **Changed:** a tab whose pane runs Claude Code has "Restart Claude" in its right-click menu, between Rename and
  Close. It stops that Claude and its children, waits up to 3 s for the pane's shell, and types
  `claude <the old flags> --resume <session id>` into it, keeping the herdr agent name. The id comes from Claude Code's
  own `<config>/sessions/<pid>.json`; with no file the restart uses `--continue` instead. The menu sends herdr's
  existing `command.invoke`, so herdr's API and protocol are unchanged.
  **Because:** the owner, 2026-10-15: "If i right click this tab and I have an option to restart the claude code
  insstance with that exact directory opened and that session resumed." Their screenshot's Claude read "Update
  installed · Restart to update".
  **Measured:** `a_tab_running_claude_offers_restart_claude`, `restart_claude_asks_the_server_for_that_tab`,
  `restart_claude_reaches_the_server_and_stops_nothing_without_claude`,
  `the_session_file_names_the_running_claudes_conversation`, `a_session_file_left_by_another_process_is_not_used`,
  `restart_keeps_the_flags_and_resumes_the_same_conversation`, `terminate_really_stops_a_running_process`,
  `the_restart_command_is_typed_as_a_plain_line`; eleven controls, `restart_*`, `session_*`, `terminate_query_only`.
  The live runs are in the plan: the first two found that herdr's Windows kill is refused (query-only handle) and that
  a stopped Claude leaves bracketed paste on; both are fixed in the fork's own code.
  **If you remove this:** restarting Claude means quitting it, finding the conversation id, and typing the resume
  command with the Nirvana theme flags by hand.

## alpha 0.1.0 (2026-10-15): the Nirvana header, its version, and reload onto the newest build

Base: herdr master b431a063 (Cargo version 0.9.5).

- **Changed:** the sidebar's first row is the brand row: a teal ◆, "Nirvana" in bold, a badge "alpha 0.1.0", and the
  sidebar toggle « at its right edge (it was at the bottom right). " spaces" moved to the second row, which upstream
  left blank, so the workspace list keeps its place.
  **Because:** the owner, 2026-10-15: "have this element for the Herdr instance [Image #11]" (Nirvana's header).
  **Measured:** `brand_row_names_nirvana_and_its_running_version`, `a_narrow_sidebar_keeps_the_toggle_and_clips_the_badge`;
  controls `header_drops_version`, `header_badge_clipped` (the live run found the badge one column short).
  **If you remove this:** the window no longer says which build it runs.
- **Changed:** the fork has its own version in nirvana/VERSION, compiled in as NIRVANA_VERSION, bumped by
  nirvana/version.py. herdr's Cargo version is left alone.
  **Because:** Nirvana's rule 16, "That way I can see if the Nirvana window is running the new version"; herdr's
  version gates its update manifest and protocol checks, so moving it would break both.
  **Measured:** `version_comes_from_the_version_file`, `VersionTest`; controls `version_not_from_file`,
  `bump_feature_keeps_fix`.
  **If you remove this:** the badge has no number of its own to show.
- **Changed:** the server's background version check reads `<home>/bin/nirvana-version.txt` every 5 s instead of
  herdr's release manifest every 30 min, and announces each newer build once through herdr's existing
  `UpdateReady`. The badge then reads "↻ 0.1.1"; a press arms it ("restart?"), a second press detaches, stops the
  server (it saves the session), and exits 75; the `nirvana-shell` supervisor starts the installed build, which
  starts a new server that restores the session. `herdr update` refuses.
  **Because:** "hot realoding the newest changes", read from Nirvana's Reload. Two presses because a restart stops
  the programs in the panes: Windows has no live handoff (src/platform/mod.rs, "Windows has no live handoff").
  **Measured:** `the_stamp_beside_the_installed_build_is_read`, `only_a_later_build_is_newer`,
  `a_newer_build_turns_the_badge_into_a_reload_button`, `reload_takes_two_presses`, `InstallTest`; controls
  `header_reload_unclickable`, `reload_single_press`, `same_build_counts_as_newer`, `install_stamps_wrong_version`,
  `install_overwrites_old_build`. The live reload run is recorded in the plan.
  **If you remove this:** a new build sits unused until someone stops herdr by hand; with the update check back on,
  herdr would offer to install upstream herdr over the fork.
- **Changed:** the default window title is "{workspace} · Nirvana" (was "{hostname}: {workspace}").
  **Because:** the owner's image reads "Downloads · Nirvana": the project in view, then the product.
  **Measured:** `nirvana_default_title_names_the_project_then_nirvana`; control `title_upstream_default`.
  **If you remove this:** the Windows Terminal tab shows the machine name instead of the project.
